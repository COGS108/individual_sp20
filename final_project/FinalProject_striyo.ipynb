    "This project seeks to explore the relationship between Yelp ratings and inspection scores. Inspection scores have been criticized before as \"misleading,\" as many minor points can be deducted. In the end, I find that the difference between distributions of inspection scores amongst different Yelp ratings is inconsequential, and that there is no relationship between Yelp ratings and health inspection scores."

    "Yelp is a website commonly used to look for restaurant recommendations. Users are able to rate the restaurant out of 5 \"stars,\" and the ratings are averaged together and displayed (alongside reviews) for other users to make their own judgements about whether or not they would wish to visit the restaurant. Yelp has been noted previously to have a substantial impact on the amount of traffic and business that a restaurant receives, making it a high-profile website in so-called \"foodie\" culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in 2018 (1), Yelp began displaying the health inspection scores of restaurants on their review pages. This garnered a fair bit of controversy: not only were the methods that Yelp used to convert local government inspection procedures to a standardized scale of 1 - 100 concerningly opaque, restauranteurs objected that the display was incredibly harmful and misleading as it could take long periods of time to properly update the restaurant's grade to its rightful status. Restaurants are concerned that this display would have a harmful effect on their ratings, and consequentially their business. \n",
    "\n",
    "After launching this program in San Francisco, Yelp found that posting a low health inspection score could decrease purchase intentions for a restaurant by 12%(2). It is safe to say that if the average customer sees that a restaurant performed poorly on a government health inspection test, they would be reluctant to engage further out of perceived health risks. This begs the question: do private, unposted health inspection scores, as they stand, have any relationship with a user's perceived quality of the restaurant?\n",

    "Consent is not too large of an issue, as restaurant health inspection scores and Yelp ratings are both public data. The main ethics issue concerning this project is regarding the human bias in collection of data, as well as the impacts of unfair health inspections towards certain restaurants—for instance, it is possible that inspectors are biased towards certain restaurants with certain Yelp ratings, and unfairly skew the data. We must also be conscious that Yelp ratings are not an absolute judge of quality, and that at the end of the day, restaurant quality can be entirely subjective. Although we may find that inspection scores have at very best a tenuous relationship with Yelp ratings, this is not to say that inspection scores are not useful metrics for determining quality.\n",

    "# Conclusion & Discussion"

   "source": [
    "Firstly, we should remember that this project only wished to evaluate the relationship between the available data of health inspection scores and Yelp ratings. Both are a product of human evaluation, and, as such, are prone to human bias. As noted above in ethics, the fact that there's no perceived difference in quality between different inspection scores doesn't mean that health inspections are absolutely useless. It is possible that Yelp ratings are mostly focused on taste and flavor, and are not as concerned as a inspector is on whether or not an employee has properly labelled a bottle of hand sanitizer in the kitchen. We also did not account for the number of Yelp reviews, which casts doubt to the true Yelp rating of the restaurants. Lower review counts suggest a more unreliable rating, and may have negatively influenced the accuracy of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, note that this project did not include some of the Yelp rating distributions in the ANOVA test. Although this ideally would not happen, I believe this to be forgiveable because we have included the distributions of a Yelp rating of 'one' and 'five,' which is the biggest rating difference possible. If there was truly a significant result to be found, then it would have surely been detected through the ANOVA test of the 'one' and 'five' distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing that even restaurants with a one star rating have roughly the same distribution in inspection scores as restaurants with a five star rating suggests that the proficiency of a restaurant in following local health ordinances has no correlation with the flavor and taste that a customer experiences. This further seems to suggest that inspectors are not swayed or biased by Yelp ratings, which supports my wish that restaurant health inspections be an unbiased process that does not take into account the popularity of the restaurant on a website. There are still other factors to be explored, such as whether a restaurant with a wealthier clientele tends to recieve better scores, but this is the conclusion when it comes to Yelp ratings.\n"
