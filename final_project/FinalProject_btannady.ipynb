    "Over the last several days, I have decided to take a closer look and analysis on data covering 18466 different food businesses in the North Carolina area. Through the analysis I attempt to discover any significant correlations between the health inspection scores and the amount of money individuals make within different zipcodes. By conducting my research, I hope to better understand how economic income may play a role in the performance of hygiene within businesses. Later I go on to conclude that the datasets provided do not show a close enough correlation to suggest that there is any significant relationship between the Per Capita Income of a food business's area and the Score it recieves from a Health Inspection."

    "In terms of research and data collection previously conducted in regards to food businesses, *North Carolina Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services* states that, food safety specialists are sent to different food distributors and manufacturers to validate that any food products expected to be consumed by humans are properly produced under \"sanitary conditions, properly labeled, stored, distributed and held under sanitary conditions\". With this in mind, all the food businesses included in the data used within this research study have previously been inspected and graded in the past. The purpose of these regulations being set in place are to ensure that all of the food products being disributed by food businesses are safe for consumption and comply to necessary guidelines. As such, any businesses that are unsuccessful in meeting these guidelines are publicly shunned for lacking in sufficient hygiene protocols. Thus, it is quite essential for successful businesses categorized in the food industry to make sure that they have a proper food safety regulations and hygiene. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, when discussing a business's success model, it can be said that many benefits in thriving business is that they begin earning higher profits. When a business is doing good, the location worth of that business's property can also correspondingly go up as well. However, although it can be said that successful food businesses are both fairly hygenic and earn a plenitude of income, are these two variables correlated? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where this research study comes in. Although it is already understood that health inspections are carried out all around North Carolina food businesses, we do not currently know if there is a direct correlation between the food business's health inspection performance and the property value of the neighborhood. My goal in this research study is to better understand how these two variables may possibly correlate with one another and what are some probable explanations.\n",

   "source": [
    "I believe that the amount of Per Capita Income that a region has, correlates with the food business in that area receiving a higher grade in their health inspection score. My reasoning for this is that poorer neighborhoods are probably less sanitary that wealthier neighborhoods because they don't have as much of a money budget to spend on routine hygenic operations. This would therefore result in the businesses located in poorer neighborhoods to more frequently get a lower health inspection score than wealthier neighborhoods."

    "Interesting. As show in the scatterplot above, there doesn't seem to be any particular linear pattern within our dataset. Keeping in mind that we are currently observing the 'averaged Health Inspection Scores of food businesses' relative to 'averaged Per Capita Income' by zipcode region, we can suggest that our hypothesis appears to be false. All the points shown in the scatterplot are quite distributed and don't show any signs of a pattern. Though to be fair, after all the data cleaning and the way we had to average out all our data into rows of *zipcodes*, we only really had 37 rows remaining in our final dataset. Perhaps with further data containing a higher amount of different zipcodes, we may have ended up with different results. However, in terms of the datasets in which we currently have from 'inspections.csv' and 'zipcodes.csv', there is no correlation between Per Capita Income and Inspection Score."

    "As shown in the histogram above, the average Inspection Score stays around 96.4 give or take. Additionally, when observing the structure of the histogram, we can also notice that it doesn't appear to be particularly skewing towards the left or the right. But honestly it's a bit hard to tell if it's well distributed because there's so little data. If the dataset provided had contained more data in regards to zipcodes, then perhaps we may have seen a different outcome. Though if I had to give an answer, the histogram is for the most part fairly balanced in terms of distribution. From this visualization we can suggest that we had a somewhat fair dataset that was not one-sided towards a specific side, but rather center skewed."

    "Based on the above histogram of the the dataset in regards to frequency of Per Capita Income Dollars, we can make several observations of its distribution and credibility. The visualization suggests that Per Capita Income Dollars are a litle bit skewed towards the right. However, this makes sense because income levels within the economy are usually never really centered and evenly spread out anyways. By this I mean that when comparing the ratio of poor people to rich people, it is commonly known that there are typically a lot more poor people than rich people. So given the slightly skewed distributions that the Per Capita Income histogram shows, we can suggest that it makes sense and appears to be realistic. "

Although, I believe that a counterargument could be that if the data shows a relevant enough of a pattern, then it can be safe to say that there is or is not a correlation with health inspection scores and a location's per capita income. \n",

    "Possible issues regarding my data would be 'underrepresentation' of all the different food businesses within the area. As of this moment, I am not fully aware whether every single restaurant and food business in the North Carolina area have had their health inspection performance made public. Additionally, I similarly cannot fully comment on whether every single zipcode within the North Carolina area has also made their income data public, although I would assume they would. With all this in mind, I'd really only be able to compare data and make an analysis based on the datasets made publicly avaiable to me. So although this data may suggest a particular outcome and answer to our research question, it is subject to change depending on the datasets provided to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the datasets two datasets that I extract information from, 'inspections.csv' and 'zipcodes.csv', should serve useful for now. In the future, I may need to independently look deeper for better datasets though. An alternate solution could also be in expanding the geographic range of my research question to not only be limited to the North Carolina area, but instead an entire contindent of zipcodes. By doing this, we'd more than likely have enough data to conduct a more thorough experiment. Though I'd imagine expanding the range of the research would sprout up its own issues. Anyways, there aren't any relevant privacy concerns as all the datasets I am using have already been made public.\n"

    "In conclusion, our hypothesis failed to be proven true based on the data that we had tested in our research study. We had tested our research question by pinning the health inspection scores and per capita income relevant to each zipcode location that food businesses were. However, after conducting further analysis we could clearly identify that there weren't any signs of a linear pattern appearing in their visualizations. Looking further into this, there can be several explanations in regards to our results.\n",

    "Lack of data. Perhaps if this research study had a larger resource of data then our results would look differently. Due to how the pairing, matching, and averaging of the data values, the final dataset really only had 37 different zipcodes to compare against eachother. With this in mind, I personally believe that next time I'd like to conduct the research with a larger dataset. As this was an independent research project and I had to use the datasets that were provided to me, I didn't really have a choice in this matter. However, it would definetely be more beneficial if the datasets provided were more diverse in terms of having different zipcodes. If there were more zipcode values, then there would similarly be a lot more rows and comparisons being made against eachother. Although the datasets provided did have plenty of *other* kinds of data information, in terms of answering this specific question, there wasn't as much data as I wish there was; most specifically, zipcodes. \n",

    "Overall this was an interesting research question to learn more about. I was highly motivated because I had a personal drive in answering my query. Although the question was eventually answered and proven to go against my initial hypothesis, I'd like to test this again in the future under better conditions. I currently am living back home in the Bay Area so it'd be interesting to try testing if San Francisco would produce similar results as this experiment. I had a ton of fun in conducting this entire research study on my own and this was very inspiring despite me being proven wrong haha. \n",
