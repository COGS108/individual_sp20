    "<b>Research Question Details:</b> <br>\n",
    "I am curious to analyze whether restaurants who are owned by a bigger business (compared to a mom/pop restaurant) might have different ratings on average. A \"chain\" refers to how large the restaurant is. For example McDonalds is a food chain which consists of thousands of restaurants worldwide. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>Food Inspection process:</b><br>\n",
    "Food inspectors come around 1-3 times a year, usually randomly or if there are customer complaints that are filed to the health and inspections website(4). The food inspection happens randomly, and then the inspector will mark down everytime they see a violation. If the violation is small, the restaurant can fix it on the spot or within a given timeframe. (You can also be penalized) If the violation is serious, the restaurant may be required to close their venue until it is fixed. Additionally, before a restaurant opens, they must pass evaluations and gain approval to reopen. <br>\n",
    "<b>Problem: </b><br>\n",
    "Based on Reddit threads, we can see there is a large variability between the punishments given to restaurants during health inspections. One health inspector shares a moment when he found a restaurant with raw food laying a broken fridge overnight, who continued to serve the meat. He ordered the meat to be thrown out but also witnessed employees taking the meat out of the garbage for reuse. He ordered for the meat to be drowned in bleach so it wouldn't be served, and the restaurant was not closed down. (2) However in another case, an aspiring restaurant owner looking to open his restaurant had clean kitchen, but was having trouble passing the health inspection to be approved to open his business.(3) I would like to find out whether there is a relation between restaurants who are not closed down and how big the business is. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>Prior work: </b><br>\n",
    "Regarding the grades of restaurants, it is noted in a report about LA County's food inspection that \"Grades below a C usually require an immediate closure of the restaurant. Restaurants with a score below C are also required to post their numeric score in the window\" (9) Which means that some restaurants may still operate with a Health Score of C, while the San Bernardino County Closures link (8) shows that most of the closed restaurants that year had a grade of B or ungraded, so there is a wide variability between whether a restaurant will be closed. <br>\n",
    "Additionally, since some health inspections may only occur from customer complaints, restaurants with less traffic may be subject to more lenient grading. The city of Boston has partnered with Yelp and Harvard to develop a method that allows them to perform more inspections in places based on complaints on yelp. (7) The issue with this method is that restaurants that may not be around the hotspot, in less popular areas may in effect be less regulated. In that case, they may be less likely to be closed over the restaurants subject to more frequent health inspections. <br>\n",

    "From a glance, it appears that in terms of critical violations, chain and non chain restaurants are pretty even, although chain restaurants have bigger outliers. This could be due to a high amount of chain restaurants than non chain restaurants. Meanwhile, when evaluating the number of non critical violations, the non critical evaluations for non chain restaurants has a higher average, despite the number of outliers that can be found in chain restaurants. This suggests that smaller restaurants tend to receive more non-critical violations compared to larger restaurants on average. "

    "For the first issue regarding privacy, I have dealt with that in my data cleaning process in which I referred to the Data Ethics and Privacy steps in order to take out important information that may identify the inspectors or businesses such as their names and phone numbers. This is important so that none of the restauratns can be impacted negatively based on the results of the data and to protect their privacy. In terms of bias in my result based on the locations of restaurants, My dataset is currently consisted of North Carolina restuarants, and I most likely use random samples to sample across the whole dataset, and perform permutation tests to make sure my values are actually significant. It would be difficult to tell whether any bias in the data is due to inspectors or locations."

    "<b>Limitations: </b> For my analysis, I split the restaurants based on two categories, however perhaps there is a different conclusion that might be drawn if I created more bins such as individual restaurants, medium sized restaurants, and large restaurants. Additionally, it would definitely have been more interesting if I could evaluate whether the restaurant would get closed down when getting a violation lower than 85, and compare the results between large restaurants and smaller ones since I think that larger restaurants may be closed down less often when compared to smaller restaurants based on the results I see from my analysis.
