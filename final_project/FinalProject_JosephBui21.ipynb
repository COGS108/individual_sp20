    "I am interested in speeding up the health inspection process for counties across America so that the time and money can be spent on more important matters. Therefore, I want to find what about a restaurant contributes to them receiving a score of 80 or lower for their health inspection score. I will be finding which variables correlate to the score the most and use these variables to create a model to find which features give the best accuracy score to predicting a score of 80 or below. Features that give the best accuracy score imply that these are the best classifiers for a low score."

    "For my project, I originally wanted to narrow it down to my home county, Santa Clara, as I am curious to what causes restaurants to receive a score of C (70 or below) for their health inspections. However, the data that I was provided does not contain much data about Santa Clara restaurants or restaurants that receive a score of 70 or below. Additionally, there was not a lot of data available online for Santa Clara retaurants and their health inspection scores. I could only find websites that showed data about why restaurants were shut down which would not help me figure out which aspects causes that problem. Therefore, in this project, I will be inspecting what about a restaurant causes their business to receive an 80 or below for their health inspection score. Based on an article I found online, it states \"one of the most obvious and difficult reasons to discuss is the presence and infestation of various pests. From rats to roaches, this is the biggest no-no to commit\" (Nutri-Rific). It is evident that pests and infestation of rodents and bugs are the main reasons why restaurants fail inspections as no one enjoys the idea of creepy animals scrambling around their ingredients or food. However, another important thing that causes restaurants to shut down are equipment issues. In addition to properly maintaining the food storage at a certain temperature, restaurants \"keeping your equipment in tip-top shape not only makes for better food but keeps your employees safer too\" (Nutri-Rific). There are factors other than vermins and poor storage temperatures that could contribute to the restaurants' poor health quality. For example, the amount of previous violations could contribute to how clean the restaurant is or the facility type of the business where different businesses have better resources than others (i.e. dine-in vs food truck). \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to the establishment of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), many food businesses were not regulated for their food production. It is important that businesses maintain their cleanliness of their restaurants so their customers do not acquire food poisoning regardless of whether or not they have an inspection test. In \"The Rise of Food Poisoning in America\", published 2014, the author writes \"In the past eight years about half of a million Americans have become sick from E. coli 0157:H7.\" which is problematic as we expect fewer outbreaks of food poisoning with the regulations we have nowadays. Customers should not have to go through the trouble of receiving medical attention from enjoying food from their local businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, using data provided by the COGS 108 instructors, I can possibly identify the main contributors to these scores that restaurants are receiving to speed up the process of inspecting restaurants so counties could spend their time and money for more important matters such as homelessness. According to the white house, \"over half a million Americans go homeless on a single night in the United States. About 35 percent (just under 200,000) are found sleeping unsheltered on our streets in places not intended for human habitation, such as sidewalks, parks, cars, or abandoned buildings\" (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-State-of-Homelessness-in-America.pdf). \n",

    "I hypothesize that both facility type and number of previous critical violations will have the most impact on what a business deserves a mediocre score of 80 or even lower. The reason to why I believe both of these variables will have the most influence is because businesses that have restaurant, dine-in facility types have the storage available to have equipments that will maintain food at certain temperatures. However, businesses such as food stands and push carts are at a disadvantage where they do not have the capability or storage to have the newest equipment to utilize for their produce. Additionally, I hypothesize the number of previous critical violations will greatly motivate a businesses to get a better score on their future health inspections as they would want to keep their business open. Of course having more features to help classify whether a restaurant received an 80 or lower than one feature itself, however, the results may differ. I will try to investigate whether there are other variables that can affect the score."

    "The `X.objectid` contains all missing values, so I plan to drop this column. As seen below, I created a function that returned thee unique values of every column to see what the data looks like. For example, I noted that `address2` had different spellings of the word 'Suite' which would not be relevent to my question. It does give me information about whether the restaurant is in a building or outdoors which is could help answer my question, however, we already have this information through `facilitytype` so it was deleted. I deleted the `description` column as it contained text of descriptions of equipment of the restaurant and the restaurant itself. This would not be particularly helpful in finding what contributes to a score of 80 as I do not plan to use Natural Language Processing to find the semantics of the text. Additionally, the descriptions are mostly notes or suggestions the restaurant should make by the inspector which isn't particularly helpful in my case. `previous_inspection_by_same_inspector` contained boolean and missing values which wouldn't help answer my question. Lastly, `inspectedby`, `inspector_id`, `days_since_previous_inspection`, `previous_inspection_date`, and `phonenumber` was deleted because it contained string values of the inspectors which also wasn't relevant to my question."

    "After assessing the columns with nominal values, I will be dealing with missing values in columns with quantitative values. These columns include: `num_non_critical_mean_previous`, `num_critical_mean_previous`, `num_non_critical_previous`, `num_critical_previous`, `second_match`, `top_match`, `avg_neighbor_num_non_critical`, and `avg_neighbor_num_critical`. As seen below, I will be imputing the mean of `top_match`, `second_match`, `num_non_critical_mean_previous`, `num_critical_mean_previous`, `avg_neighbor_num_non_critical`, and `avg_neighbor_num_critical` because these are averages and not counts. I will need to fill `num_non_critical_previous` and `num_critical_previous` with 0 as these missing values were due to restaurants having their first inspections, so they do not have a previous count of violations."

Restaurants who tend to have a lower number of total violations will receive higher scores while restaurants who break more violations tend to receive lower scores. Now, I want to find the pairwise correlation of all columns in the dataframe so I can see the correlation values between each column and `below_80`. I plan to find which variables correlate with `below_80` the most so I can use these features to classify whether the score received an 80 or lower."

    "Because our p-value is greater than our significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of how food stands/push carts and restaurants are not statistically significantly different in the scores they receive. This makes sense as it correlates to what I found earlier where there is an average of 0.00116 more restaurants receiving 80 or lower on their scores compared to other facility types. Even though there is more data on restaurants than food stands/push carts, I believe our sample size is reasonable enough (~3500) to run a hypothesis test. "

Therefore, I should be respectful by not including the names of restaurants as they would like to keep their repuation as a business. One failed inspection shouldn't define a restaurant as they can improve their sanitation to receive better scores. Due to the fact that I did not have their verbal/written consent, I must not include informatin that can uniquely identify an individual such as name, address, and phone number according to the Safe Harbor guidelines. I would like to acknowledge the restaurants and health inspectors for giving me an opportunity to use this data to further investigate my question. \n",

There may be bias in how the data was collected as all humans are not the same. For example, different restaurants could receive different scores based on the inspector. There may be inspectors who are more lenient or harsh than others. However, I believe that I dealt with this discreptancy while creating my pipeline model as I standardized the quantitative data values so that it makes it easier to compare the scores. Another thing that can be biased about the data is how restaurants can lie to inspectors about some thing which could skew the data which I could not really account for in my analysis."

    "Throughout my data analysis and visualizations, I conclude that the most important aspects of a restaurant that contributes to them having a inspection score of 80 or lower are: the number of critical violations and non-critical violations committed on current and previous inspections. This contradicts my hypothesis as I believed that only the facility type and the number of previous critical violations would heavily influence if a restaurant received an 80 or lower. However, it turned out that all 4 of the variables influence the score. Obviously, the number of critical and non-critical violations done for that inspection will heavily determine the score. However, it turns out that the previous number of violations also determine the score whether it is critical or not. This concurs with my visualization that shows the relationship between previous violations and score which means that restaurants who broke more violations tend to receive lower scores in their future inspections. This could occur because restaurants who break too many violations are forced to shut down which lowers the businesses' profit. Because their business is failing, they either give up on their business or do not have the money to keep it sanitary. Additionally, it turns out that there are no other variables, especially nominal data, that can contribute to the score such as `geostatuscode`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, my analysis showed that there is no significant difference between facility types which surprises me. I hypothesized that businesses with a smaller facility type are more likely to receive a lower score due to the lack of resoruces. As previously mentioned, I ran a simulation on two different facility types, food stands/push carts & restaurants where I had data on 11985 restaurants and 3380 food stands/push carts. Both of these samples are a reasonable sample since, but I am quite weary with whether standardizing these values made a difference on the analysis. I feel like the data limitation of having fewer data on food stands/push carts should be considered as it may seem like there is no difference on the two samples right now, but could be different when the two samples are comparable sizes. This is called the Simpson Effect. Overall, this can be helpful in speeding up the health inspection process as counties can spend their time inspecting restaurants with a bad history of breaking a large number of violations first. "
