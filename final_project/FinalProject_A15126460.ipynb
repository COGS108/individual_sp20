    " In order to help improve the health inspection process of the restaurants in North Carolina, we need to explore some useful information in inspection process. When we have the violation records of these restaurants, what can we learn from these ? It is inefficient to do very detailed health inspection on every restaurants and every aspects. Perhaps, It will be better if we can focus on some restaurants or some aspects to do detailed inspection."

    " Form the inspection manage system , during the health inspection process, the inspector record the different violation types that are: NA=Not Applicable\t \tNO=Not Observed\t \tCDI=Corrected During Inspection\t \tR=Repeat Violation\t \tVR=Verification Required\t\n",

    "  2. The inspecting frequency: \n",
    "  In the state of North Carolina, foodservice establishments such as restaurants, take-out or delivery food businesses, school cafeterias and institutions (hospital, nursing home, etc.) are to be inspected at a frequency that is determined by the complexity of the menu and the susceptibility of the population served. There are four risk categories with a corresponding inspection frequency.Risk Category I establishments are inspected once per year, do not serve potentially hazardous foods and are most often bars or coffee shops that use reusable cups or drinking glasses.\n",
    "Risk Category II establishments are inspected twice per year, have limited menus with simple food preparation procedures and are primarily cook and serve type establishments.\n",
    "Risk Category III establishments are inspected three times per year, have a more complex menu and cook some foods in advance, then refrigerate the foods to be reheated and served at a later time.\n",
    "Risk Category IV establishments are inspected four times per year, have the most complex menus that involve cooking, cooling and reheating of several foods or they serve a highly susceptible population such as children, elderly persons or those who may\n",
    "be immunocompromised.\n",
    "  3. the predcition of NYC restaurant health inspection has some thing I can learn from. For example, they made assumpotions that the food type, the stree, the name, zipcode and borough might be useful features to use, which inspire me to think about maybe the years of opened is also related. \n",

What is more, \"Utensils and Equipment\" , \"Phisical Facilities\", \"Proper use of utensils'and \"Prevention of Food Contamination\" have realtively larger percentage of repaeated violations among all of their violations respectively. These are useful informations for us to learn because government can be more strict when they inspect these categoties next time. In conclusion, my first hypothesis is very close to this result. "

The questions may have influences on inspectors work load since the project will suggest some specific aspects or restaurants to have detailed inspections or stronger penalty. My project will also influence the restaurants' profit and reputations. \n",
    "3. The Data: The data came from the health inpsection department. The violations was collectied by inspector and reconrded during inpection process. The restaurant data was recorded by when the restaurant ask for permission to do business from the local government. I don't think restaurant data have any biased because the information are all required to offer when it opened. There indid some possibble biased of the violations dataset. For example, there are some missing value in the violationtype columns. It is possible that the inspector did not report honesly about the problem, which may due to the personal relationship between inspector and restaurant owner. The possibilities of bribery should also be considered here. To handle this, the best way is to drop the missing data. \n"

    "       In conclusion, the questions are answered successfully by my project. What kind of violation category are tends to have repeated violations? \"Utensils and Equipment\" , \"Physical Facilities\" are the two categories that are most likely to have repeated violations. \"Potentially Hazardous Food Time/Temperature\" and \"Protection from Contamination\" are the two categories that have the most violations. What is more, \"Utensils and Equipment\" , \"Physical Facilities\", \"Proper use of utensils'and \"Prevention of Food Contamination\" have relatively larger percentage of repeated violations among all of their violations respectively. These are useful information’s for inspectors to do a more effective inspection next time. Is repeated violations related to restaurant open years? The answer is No; \n",
    "   \n",
    "       My analysis focus on the relationships between variables. In specific, drawing graphs based on pivot table and comparing the distribution and stats on the open years.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "       possible limitation is about the combined dataset. The repeated violation type is much fewer than CDI. There are enough violations data but when combine with restaurants, there are lots of objectID which did not match. The analysis will be more successful if we have more data on the combined dataset. The project may affect the work load of the inspector and reputations or profit of a restaurant. \n"
