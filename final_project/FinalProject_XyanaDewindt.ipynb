    "At first I wanted to investigate the relationship between health inspection scores and food related illnesses in North Carolina. After reviewing the given data sets, I noticed that no specific cases of food related illnesses were included and decided to look at the potential relationship between health inspection scores and critical vs. non-critical violations. By combining the given data sets (inspections.csv, and violations.csv) to make graphical observations I was able to conclude a positive correlation between these two variables, in that violations that are considered more critical do impact health inspection scores significantly, which could evidentely lead to  more foodborne illnesses.

    "This question was sparked by my curiosity in finding out information in regards to health inspections within different areas of our country and to see whether or not there is a relationship between inspection scores and the violations received. Based on the given data sets, I am able to analyze this relationship within the state of North Carolina.\n",
    "\n",
    "North Carolina requires a health inspection to be administered at random at least once a year, and can require more frequent visits based on the score and possible violations received. These health inspections are administered in order to let the public know how clean the business is and how likely the potential violations found will make one sick. Just like in many other states, the scoring is based on a letter grade, where A is equal to a score of 90 or above, B is in the 80's, and C is a score in the 70's. According to the North Carolina law, if a business is given a score of 69 or below, the business will have to close.(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a certain amount of categories the inspectors asses and give point values to based on how the business is doing in that category. The point values given, which essentially determine the letter grade the businneses receive, are based on the risk of spreading foodborne ilnesses. Some of the categories that cause for the largest point deductions include food temperature and handling issues.(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to other states and especially counties like San Diego, where I reside, Wake County, a major county in North Carolina, inspections seem a bit stricter and thus businesses are looked down upon when their score is below a 90. The health inspections are meant to help/educate business owners and their employees so they are given a second chance if their score is below a 90 initially.(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015, Wake County conducted a risk factor study in which 447 food extablishments were randomly selected to be evaluated and observed in relation to risks of foodborne illnesses. The main purpose of this study was to compare results with a similar study conducted in 2010 and hopefully see improvement, which there was if you take a look at their data and conclusion. This study contains helpful information in regards to my research question as I can use their findings and make my own connections on the relationship between health inspections scores and the criticallity of the violations the businesses received.(3)\n",

    "Food related businesses in North Carolina who receive a higher health inspection score are less likely to have received very critical violations and are thus less likely to cause foodborne illnesses. This is due to the fact that these health inspections are administered in order to let the public know how clean the business is and how likely the potential violations found will make one sick. The score received is based on the categories the businnesses violated during their inspection.  "

    "I decided to focus on the correlation between a health inspection score received and the number of critical violations that were found during this inspection. I initially wanted to focus on the potential relationship between health inspection scores and foodborne illnesses, because I was curious to see if one does affect the other like you might assume. Because I was limited to the data we were provided (I attempted finding data on my own but it was more difficult than I had anticipated) I had to change my research question and hypothesis to fit what was available to me. I realized that whatever my findings would be on the relationship between health inspection scores and critical violations, could be similar to the original questions I wanted to persue. I could continue this project in the future and find better data that fits that question and compare findings from this project to those. \n",
    "\n",
    "I did find a relationship between the two variables, in that health inspection scores are expected to decrease if the business receives a higher amount of critical violations. I was able to come to this conclusion after cleaning and merging data sets and eventually the use of a t-test, followed by taking a look at linear regression data. The visualizations I created were helpful to visually provide some of the data, but when I looked at the scatter plot I created, it didn't suggest a very strong relationship as there were some outliers. I was able to notice a slight relationship here, but needed to confirm it which I did subsequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to prove my hypothesis which stated that food related businesses in North Carolina who received a higher number of critical violations receive a lower health inspection score, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionaly I wanted to include some limitations I found during the entirety of this project. At first I didn't have all the data I wanted to research the questions I asked. I also omitted certain variables which were part of the original data sets, which could mean that my analysis isn't as in depth. There were probably also other factors that could have affected health inspection score, not just critical violations. Laslty, the conclusions drawn can only be mentioned in regards to the cities listed on the data sets, not the entirety of the state of North Carolina. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to study the relationships between variables in the world of health inspections. These health inspections are what help food related businesses learn and keep their customers happy and safe from foodborne illnesses."
