    "Since living and attending school in San Diego, I have experienced a myriad of restuarants in the county. From personal experience these restaurants that have high ratings on review sites, such as yelp, also tend to have high health inspection grades, indicating that they have had few health violations. So, that lead to the question: does restaurants with high ratings on review sites tend to have lower amounts of health violations?\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been researched that ratings and reviews on restaurants have been able to find occurences of health violations even after proper inspections. So much so that Ashley Smith from Eurekalert has gone so far as to say that health inpections combined with reviews from review sites drive consistent good hygiene at restaurants. With that in mind, we will be looking at data on restaurants in North Carolina given for use for this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the creation of Yelp in 2004, business nationwide and worldwide have the ability to promote their business while interacting with their customers through reviews. Yelp is one of the leading customer review websites, averaging 29 million unique visitors on the Yelp app and 64 million unique visitors on the Yelp website. To see if our hypothesis is true, we will be utilizing star ratings from Yelp to determine whether location determines if a restaurant had a high or low amount of health violations.\n",

    "My hypothesis is that occurences of health violations for a restaurant will decline as they having higher ratings on Yelp. This is important because we would be able to see if high rated reviews on these review sites are driving these restaurants to maintain good hygiene. It would also allow us to see if these review sites are actually making an impact on these restaurants to care about their hygiene for instances other than health inpections. This tool could be useful for determing which restaurants are safe to eat at other than just looking at the letter grade displayed at their windows."
