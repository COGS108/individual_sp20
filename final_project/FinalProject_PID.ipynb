    "During the current COVID-19 pandemic that we are also experiencing, the health and safety of a community are now its top priority. Food safety has become increasingly common as people disinfect their groceries as soon as they get home. In this time, ensuring health inspections are being carried out properly and to the correct standards is critical to public safety and halting the spread of germs. This begs us to look for ways to improve health inspections and ask questions about the relationships between inspection ratings and the number of COVID cases per neighborhood in LA County. Do worse health inspection ratings correlate to a higher number of cases in a specific neighborhood?\n",
    "    \n",
    "In LA County, health inspections are carried out on a rating scale of 1 to 100. A business starts with the full 100 points and is then deducted points depending on the severity of each infraction found during the inspection. Depending on its score it is then issued a grade of A for 90-100, B for 80-89, C for 70-79, and a Fail for anything below a 70. The three levels of violations are minor, major, and critical with any critical violation resulting in an automatic fail regardless of the score [1]. Because the COVID-19 outbreak has occurred so recently there are no prior projects on this topic, though there are a few that are similar. One project looks at Yelp ratings for restaurants in neighborhoods around Toronto to see if lower income neighborhoods have worse service, and therefore worse ratings [2]. This is similar to my question as the number of COVID cases is also broken down by neighborhoods in Los Angeles to analyze any possible correlation. Although this project determined that there is no correlation between Yelp ratings and neighborhood income, this does not discount possible relationships between neighborhood income and health inspection ratings. As such neighborhood income might have an unseen effect on health inspections and thus an unseen effect on the spread of COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second project I found is more directly related to my question as they used the Yelp Health Inspection System, called LIVES, to analyze and identify specific regions of San Francisco with high numbers of health violations [3]. This project did not correlate to neighborhood income, however, but instead has higher violations coming from more high-trafficked areas around SF. My question takes this one step further by asking how LA County neighborhoods with higher frequencies and severities of health inspection infractions affect the spread of COVID-19. \n",

    "I believe that lower health inspection scores does in fact correlate to a higher number of COVID-19 cases, which could serve as an explanation to why lower income neighborhoods have been affected the most by this pandemic. Because the COVID-19 virus can live on surfaces, it serves to think that restaurants with worse health inspection ratings are not as clean and might therefore be contributing more heavily to the spread of the virus. If this is true then it would explain a higher number of cases in those neighborhoods, which I predict to be lower income neighborhoods."
