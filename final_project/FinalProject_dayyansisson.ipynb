    "# Overview\n",
    "In this project, I analyzed the relationship between ethnic diversity in a locality and critical health inspection statistics in cities in North Carolina. I used the provided data and public census data to build data sets containing information on restaurant's cuisines, health inspection records, and the diversity data on its surrounding locality. After analysis, I concluded that there was no significant relationship between ethnic diversity in a locality and critical health inspection statistics in cities in North Carolina."

    "## Background and Prior Work\n",
    "There has been research done on race, age, class based disparities in levels of inspections carried out by the EPA, which has led some research to suggest that measures must be taken to improve the equity of the inspection process (1). This research was conducted looking at, in a community, the percentage of African Americans, percentage of Hispanics, low SES index, amongst other variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, research has shown that \"Food safety compliance amongst ethnic minority food retail businesses has been identified as being less than satisfactory\", and that \"the research recognizes that language difficulties and lack of knowledge and understanding of the principles of food safety are a major barrier to promoting food safety\" (2).\n",

    "# Hypothesis\n",
    "My hypothesis, is that health ratings in localities with more ethnic diversity than will be lower than those with less ethnic diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that barriers in language, lower levels of food safety education, and challenges related to the equity in which health inspections are carried out result in lower food safety ratings in ethnically diverse communities. Communities with less diversity (even if the population is largely composed of American racial minorities) will have, in general, higher food safety ratings, since equitable inspections can be carried out more easily amongst a singular target population."

The uszips data set contains no personally identifying information and contains exclusively public data. The demographic data was gathered from the census all of the collected data has already been made public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this question potentially relates to the equity of health inspections in major cities, it is important to consider its potential effects. If the stated hypothesis is true, the relationships defined in the research might point local governments to inequities in food safety education, the conduct of health inspection, and even the demographics of the institutions carrying out the health inspections.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was not able to confirm my hypothesis, but the analysis did show a discrepancy in health scores given between restaurants labelled as 'ethnic' versus those that weren't. This has potential implications on the way local health inspectors carry out inspections. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that there was significantly more data on restaurants not labelled as 'ethnic'. This may introduce biases that may have led us to conclude that there was a larger difference in mean health scores between the two groups than there actually were.\n",
    "\n",

    "From this data analysis, we can reject our hypothesis that health ratings in localities with more ethnic diversity than will be lower than those with less ethnic diversity, since there is no clear linear relationship between our measure of diversity and our health statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "My analysis was limited, since there was not enough enough localities included in the study to carry out statistical analysis on the locality level. Since diversity information could not be generated on the individual restaurant level, our data suffered from binning which may have prevented more complete analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did find however, that there is statistically significant difference between the mean health scores for a restaurant and whether or not it is a restaurant that serves American foods. On average, restaurants that served ethnic foods were given lower health scores and on average received more health violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand why this difference occurs. Is the health inspection process equitable, or is it overpenalizing restaurants that sell ethnic foods? Additionally, is there a need to overcome barriers in language and/or increase levels of food safety education? Further analysis will be needed to determine this."
