    "In this data analysis project, I utilize data retrieved from previous health inspections performed in North Carolina (primarily the Raleigh area) on food establishments to discover whether or not repeated violations is a sign of a clean food establishment. I utilized a unique ID associated to a restauant from two data sets. From the first I also retrieved a boolean value as to whether there are repeated violations from that restaurant, and from the second I retrieved the cleanliness scores of the restaurants with their latest health inspection (score, and number of critical/non-critical violations). I split the cleanliness scoring variables into two sets that differ in terms of repeated violations; as a result, exploratory data analysis along with t-test procedures confirm that repeated violations represents a statistically higher chance of that establishment having a lower cleanliness score."

These researchers took a sample of restaurants and checked for the amount of repeated violations during health inspections for restaurants that were both \"high-threat\" and \"medium-threat\" in terms of health safety standards. What was found was that the \"high-threat\" restaurants were indeed found to carry many more repeated violations than the \"medium-threat\" restaurant, which leads me to believe I may find a similar result in this data set.\n",

It is noted in this article that \"repeated deficiencies\" (seperate, repeated instances of not meeting a required health standard) has a big effect on the restaurants threat level. I believe this gives me some confidence in my hypothesis for this research project. "

The difference between the two, relative to the range, isn't too significant, but it's interesting enough to continue on.\n",

    "\n",
    "- I am concerned of bias in the way I split the two groups - I split them by if they had an repeated violations in their history, but I did not seperate this into the different categories for different *types* of restaurants, which risks a confounding variable.\n",
    "- In terms of ethics, I believe that the personal situations of the workers at these restaurants is important to keep in mind. Shutting down a restaurant using predictions based on repeated violations could result in major issues for the workers, as it could have been the business head's fault, or perhaps a single employee, but this affects the incomes and homes of many.\n",
    "- Privacy concerns include utilizing the information in the dataset, some of which I did not utilize. I was originally thinking of a research project based on the person who is performing the inspection, but that name would definitely have issues with privacy. A solution to this may have been to encrypt their names, but keeping a unique identifier to perform the data analysis."

    "In this research project I set out to find whether or not a particular variable (the existence of previous repeated violations) is a good predictor of the scores being received in health inspection violations. The data I used was split into two dataframes, the first of which represents a row for one health inspection done on one restaurant. I pulled out 4 features from this set - unique restaurant id, cleanliness score, number of critical violations, and number of noncritical violations. The last three variables is what I used to determine cleanliness of the establishment, and the ID is utilized to associate each row in the first dataframe to the second. The second dataframe represents a row for every health inspection violation that has been recorded for these restaurants (within a large time frame). I can associate the first ID with the ID from this table, and the only other feature I take from this table is whether or not that establishment has repeat violations (I did this through some basic searching counting in programming logic, using some dataframe logic).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, I cleaned my data and then split the original dataset into two parts - one with establishments that havent repeated a violation, and another with establishments that have. I then utilized seaborn to graph distribution plots of the cleanliness scores between the two groups for some exploratory data analysis, in which we could see a significant difference. In order to confirm that these distribution were normal as they seemed, I ran normal tests on all of them and they did indeed all pass the normal test. Finally, I utilized a t-test from the scipy.stats kit to compare the two data distributions with eachother, one variable at a time: first overall score, then the number of critical violations, then the number of noncritical violations. This resulted in all three t-tests giving us a statistically significant difference between the data sets. Now that we know it is significant, we can simply print out some information about the average of the two sets to confirm that the direction of the significance was expected - and after calculating some averages of the new datasets, I was able to verify that my hypothesis was indeed correct - a history of repeated violations does have a significant impact on current health inspection scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information can be utilized in a very positive way. Firstly, we can simply look through a restaurants past to see if they have any repeated violations before performing a health inspection - perhaps in this case the inspector can either give a more thorough (and/or more strict) inspection for restaurants that have a past of repeated violations. This can even be extended for violations that have been repeated more than once, keeping a variable-statistic of this, I'm confident an even more statistically significant difference can be found between establishmnets of high repeating-violation statistics verus low. I think that this can impact the way we handle health inspections, of course leading to safer and better eateries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only limitation I noticed was the difficulty in finding extra data sets that I can combine with the given ones. The given ones have unique identifiers that are unfortunately not available in other data sets, and in the ways that I was thinking, couldn't find a solution to implementing. Besides, that, there were little limitations given that these data sets were so large and thorough."
