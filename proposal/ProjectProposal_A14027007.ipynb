    "My potential research question would be finding out if health inspections are done efficiently enough to make sure inspections are delivering the intended effect: keeping restaurants hygienic and safe for customers and restaurant workers. I would be exploring date of inspection/time of inspection/zip code/street address/type of cuisine to make sure if the inspections are done well enough to represent a restaurant's performance throughout the entire year instead of just one day when the inspection is performed, as well as evaluating the need for more frequent inspection if the budget allows.\n"

    "An ideal dataset would be a list of all the inspections done in the past few years (at least 2-3) by the local government. If available, using datasets from other local governments from nearby areas may be also useful.\n",

    "- Inspection Score\n",

    "The dataset would preferably be in CSV/TSV/XLS format, or XML if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data would have been collected and released by the local health department as they are the ones responsible for the inspections, although an API/third-party website will exist and could be a more efficient source of data (e.g. Yelp uses an API called HDScores for importing health inspection scores into their website under a separate \"Health Score/Inspections\" section for each restaurant, and is thus the largest & most reliable source of data after the SD Food Info website, which is maintained directly by SDC DEH but is harder to scrape data from).\n",

    "If dealing with multiple datasets due to restrictions (e.g. if the list of inspections were separated by area), each dataset would be used separately in the project for specific explorations, or merged to give a more general insight."
