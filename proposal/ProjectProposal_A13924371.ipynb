    "The 1000 genomes project has full genetic data from over 2500 individuals, from which they obtained DNA samples and sequences their full genome. The DNA contains four different nucleotides: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Thymine (T). While a certain sequence may normally be A-G-C-C-G-T-A-A-A, it is possible for a certain nucleotide to be accidentally replaced by a different nucleotide through errors in replication, so what was previously an A could become instead a G, C, or T. This mutation is called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). For this project, I plan on clustering areas of the genome by how susceptiple to SNPs the areas are, in order to show how different areas may be more prone to mutation than others. "
