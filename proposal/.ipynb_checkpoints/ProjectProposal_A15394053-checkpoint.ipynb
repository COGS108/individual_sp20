    "<b>Food Inspection process:</b><br>\n",
    "Food inspectors come around 1-3 times a year, usually randomly or if there are customer complaints that are filed to the health and inspections website(4). The food inspection happens randomly, and then the inspector will mark down everytime they see a violation. If the violation is small, the restaurant can fix it on the spot or within a given timeframe. (You can also be penalized) If the violation is serious, the restaurant may be required to close their venue until it is fixed. Additionally, before a restaurant opens, they must pass evaluations and gain approval to reopen. <br>\n",
    "<b>Problem: </b><br>\n",
    "Based on Reddit threads, we can see there is a large variability between the punishments given to restaurants during health inspections. One health inspector shares a moment when he found a restaurant with raw food laying a broken fridge overnight, who continued to serve the meat. He ordered the meat to be thrown out but also witnessed employees taking the meat out of the garbage for reuse. He ordered for the meat to be drowned in bleach so it wouldn't be served, and the restaurant was not closed down. (2) However in another case, an aspiring restaurant owner looking to open his restaurant had clean kitchen, but was having trouble passing the health inspection to be approved to open his business.(3) I would like to find out whether there is a relation between restaurants who are not closed down and how big the business is. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>Prior work: </b><br>\n",
    "Regarding the grades of restaurants, it is noted in a report about LA County's food inspection that \"Grades below a C usually require an immediate closure of the restaurant. Restaurants with a score below C are also required to post their numeric score in the window\" (9) Which means that some restaurants may still operate with a Health Score of C, while the San Bernardino County Closures link (8) shows that most of the closed restaurants that year had a grade of B or ungraded, so there is a wide variability between whether a restaurant will be closed. <br>\n",
    "Additionally, since some health inspections may only occur from customer complaints, restaurants with less traffic may be subject to more lenient grading. The city of Boston has partnered with Yelp and Harvard to develop a method that allows them to perform more inspections in places based on complaints on yelp. (7) The issue with this method is that restaurants that may not be around the hotspot, in less popular areas may in effect be less regulated. In that case, they may be less likely to be closed over the restaurants subject to more frequent health inspections. <br>\n",

    "I think that there is a relationship between the closure of a restaurant who received a grade lower than 85 and the size of the restaurant chain it is part of. I think that restaurants who have less chains may be subject to restaurant closures more often, even if they may have similar scores compared to larger chains. I think that a larger chain may have some sort of name bias or advantage that leads them to being less likely closed. "

    "<u>Data collection</u><br>\n",
    "The data collected would most likely be from the data that is released to the public regarding the closure of the restaurants. If further data is  needed to evaluate the size of the restaurant, the data would need to be collected through webscraping or online search. One way to figure out the size of the restaurant is to scrape yelp to find the restaurants that have the similar names, and count the amount of chains using this method, however the issue with this is that there might be restaurants with the same names but not related. <br> Further research would be needed to see what data is provided by the California Health and Food Inspection.\n",
