# Individual Projects: Sp20

This is the repo we'll use for your final project for COGS108.

This repository is public.

This repository will be frozen on the final project due date: 11:59pm on Wednesday, June 10th. No further changes can be made after that time. All pull requests must be made prior to deadline.

Your project proposal and final project will be graded based solely on the corresponding project notebook in this repository.

You'll fork this repository and then, by each due date, you will submit a pull request with your notebook to this repository

This will have a notebook present in this appropriate folder (either `proposal` or `final_project`). The file in your pull request should have the following file name (where PID is replaced by *your* PID):

- 'ProjectProposal_PID.ipynb'
- 'FinalProject_PID.ipynb'
